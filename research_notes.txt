To define a research topic and objectives clearly, follow these steps:

1. **Select a Topic**: Start with an idea that interests you. Consider what type of patients or population you want to research regarding a specific problem or issue.

2. **Analyze the Topic**: Determine what kind of information you need. Test your topic ideas with available resources to see if you can find relevant and appropriate information.

3. **Formulate Research Objectives**: Research objectives should be specific, clear, and achievable. They guide the development and design of the study and help focus on project goals. Objectives can be general or specific, often developed from hypotheses that aim to test them.

4. **Importance of Research Objectives**: Clear objectives help avoid unnecessary data collection and ensure that the research stays on track. They drive data collection, analysis, and conclusions.

**Step 2: Conducting a Literature Review**

A literature review is essential for gathering existing information and identifying gaps in research. Here are the key steps to conduct a literature review:

1. **Define Your Research Question**: Clearly articulate the specific research question that your literature review will address. This question should guide your search for relevant literature.

2. **Understand the Literature Review in Your Discipline**: Familiarize yourself with existing literature in your field. Find a published article related to your topic to understand the ongoing conversation and structure your review.

3. **Determine Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**: Establish criteria for what literature will be included in your review. This helps in narrowing down the relevant studies and articles.

4. **Choose Databases and Conduct the Search**: Identify appropriate databases (e.g., academic journals, scholarly books) to search for literature. Use specific keywords related to your research question to find relevant studies.

5. **Review Results**: Carefully examine the abstracts of the articles you find to determine if they fit within the scope of your literature review. Analyze the research questions and findings of each study to assess their relevance.

6. **Critical Analysis**: Conduct a critical analysis of the literature collected. Look for trends, patterns, and gaps in the existing research. This analysis will help you understand where your research fits within the broader academic conversation.

7. **Synthesize Findings**: Summarize and synthesize the findings from the literature to support your research question and objectives. This will help justify your research and highlight the need for further investigation in specific areas.
